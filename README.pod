=head1 Set::DynamicGroups

An object to manage dynamic groups of items.

You can define groups of items based on explicit lists of members
and build groups dynamically based on other groups.

Useful for ACLs,
applying transformations to groups of fields,
or any other application where you'd like to base
processing rules on groups and be flexible about what those groups contain.

See module POD for more information.
